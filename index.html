        <h3 style="text-align: center;">My name is Ivaylo and I am a Python programmer with a focus

            <p>I am working with Python and C programming languages in CLI development, cybersecurity, 
                and penetration testing.</p>
            
            <p>I have completed online courses in programming, pentesting, and cybersecurity through 
                Udemy and Harvard University's CS50 program and I have over 10 years of experience in 
                the field of computer technologies, programming, and cybersecurity. I'm now focused 
                on applying my skills to real-world projects and collaborating with others in the 
                cybersecurity community.</p>
            
            <p>I'm looking for opportunities to collaborate on open-source projects and contribute to 
                cybersecurity and pentesting initiatives. I'm also open to feedback on my code and 
                learning from others in the community.</p>
