            <p><b>NetworkScanner</b> is CLI program whose purpose is to discover devices connected in 
                the network by a given range of IP addresses. The program returns on screen the IP of 
                the device and also the hostname. It works on both Linux and Windows systems.</p>

            <h3>Scan a device from the network for open ports.</h3>
            <p><b>PortScanner</b> is a Python based CLI program intended to scan a device from the 
                network for open ports. By default the program will scan a predifined selection of 
                100 ports, but you can specify a list of ports, or even a single port, to be scanned 
                by using the optional argument -p, --ports and type a list of port numbers separated 
                by spaces. <b>PortScanner</b> will show the currently scanned ports in terminal using 
                colors to indicate open (green color) and closed (red color) ports. After the scan is 
                complete you will be able to see a summary of all the open ports found on the scanned 
                device. The program has also an option to save the result in a text file. To do that add 
                -O, --output as an optional argument in the command.</p>

            <h3>Web scanner for existing (and/or hidden) directories.</h3>
            <p><b>WebScanner</b> is a Python program intended to scan and discover existing and/or hidden 
                directories (and web objects) on a web server using a wordlist file to perform a dictionary 
                based enumeration. Basically I created my own basic version of the popular 
                <a href="https://dirb.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" title="DIRB official web site">
                    <i>DIRB</i></a> program. <b>WebScanner</b> allows you to select your own (custom) 
                    <i>User-Agent</i>. Currently the program shows the result of the scanning only in the 
                terminal window, but I am planning to add an option to export the result into a file.</p>

            <h3>CLI program for Windows that will prevent the system from going to sleep.</h3>
            <p><b>Coffee</b> is CLI program for Microsoft Windows based systems. I was inspired by 
                the command <i>caffeinate</i> on Mac systems that is used to prevent them in entering 
                sleep mode. So I wrote my own version of this command for Microsoft Windows and it 
                quickly became my most used command or program. Simply type <i>coffee</i> in the Command 
                Prompt or Windows PowerShell from the directory where you saved the program and your system 
                will show a nice ASCII cup of coffee on the terminal and will stay awake.</p>

            <h3>Process information tool for Linux and Windows.</h3>
            <p><b>pstool</b> is a CLI program whose purpose is to list the loaded processes in a Linux 
                or Windows based system and to give detailed information about each one of them, such as 
                the <b>process ID</b>, <b>executable name</b>, <b>command line parameters</b> with which 
                the process was started, and the <b>network or Internet connections</b> of the process if 
                any. The program can show the information for a specific process or group of processes of 
                a program, giving you the ability to search by <i>name</i>, <i>PID (process ID)</i>, or 
                <i>process status</i>.</p>
